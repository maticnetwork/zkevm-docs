## Minimum Hardware Configuration

This is the minimum hardware configuration required to setup a full node:

- RAM: 16-32 GB
- CPU: 4-8 core CPU (For AWS: **t3.2xlarge**)
- Storage: 2.5TB to 5TB SSD (make sure it is extendable)

:::tip

The minimum storage requirements will change over time as the network grows. It is recommended to use more than the minimum requirements to run a robust full node.

:::

While we do not favor any operating system, **more secure and stable** Linux server distributions (like CentOS) should be preferred over desktop operating systems (like Mac OS and Windows).
