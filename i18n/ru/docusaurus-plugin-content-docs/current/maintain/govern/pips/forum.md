The [Polygon Community Forum](forum.polygon.technology) is the central hub
of the Polygon ecosystem, where community members, developers, validators,
and projects deployed on Polygon PoS come together to collaborate on protocol
changes and share ideas and issues around the Polygon ecosystem and its various
products.

Completely open, accessible, and transparent, the forum welcomes newcomers
to join in building the future of scaling solutions for Ethereum. In addition
to meeting other creative community members, the forum offers an excellent
opportunity to learn about how different Polygon solutions are integrated into
projects. It's also a great place to propose and discuss different types of Polygon
Improvement Proposals, ranging from informational to core protocol changes.

If you haven't already, sign up [here](forum.polygon.technology), and be sure to
check out the [next page for the community guidelines](community-guidelines.md).
