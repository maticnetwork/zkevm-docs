Wallets that support Polygon allow for key management, access to accounts controlled by private keys, and interfaces that allow users to perform chain actions and sign transactions. The following page serves as a wallet index for wallets compatible with Polygon. Please note that this is not an exhaustive index.

:::caution Third-party wallets

These third-party wallets have integrated Polygon and support a variety of features. **You should use your own due diligence in researching and using them**. The official Polygon Support cannot provide support for issues with these wallets or other non-native wallets.

:::caution *Non-native wallet support

Wallets denoted with * in the table above are not natively supported with the wallet software and require manual steps to add the Polygon network.

## Key Management Strategy

The following basic steps allow for the integration a client-side application with Polygon:

1. **Set up Web3**: [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) is a javascript library that allows a client-side application to talk to the blockchain. We configure web3 to communicate via a developer-based wallet like MetaMask. Use the [web3.js docs](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.2/getting-started.html#adding-web3-js) to learn about adding `web3.js` to your project.
2. **Set up an Account**: You will be able to send transactions (specifically ones that alter the state of the blockchain).
3. **Instantiate Contracts**: Once a web3 object in place, we next instantiate our deployed contract, with which we interact.
4. **Call functions**: Fetch data via functions in the contract - through our contract object.
